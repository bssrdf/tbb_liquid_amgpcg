This is a liquid solver featuring FLIP advection and AMGPCG pressure solver,
this solver was modified from christopher batty's original implemention of
 "variational fluid solver(BBB07)"

In addtion, it has a Signed distance field initializer(but inefficient), so it
is possible for one to use this solver with more complicated static scenes.
the obj input HAS TO BE A CLOSED MESH. 

this solver outputs liquid meshes(in obj file) which can be then rendered by maya.

you need intel tbb installed in order to have this build.
